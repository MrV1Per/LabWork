The task:
The permutation P = (p1,p2,p3,p4) of the elements of the set (1,2,3,4) and the  4x4 matrix D = [d(ij)] are specified.
Determine the value of the function F(P) = Sum(d(p(i),p(i+1))), P(m+1) = P(1) and print it. 
Initial data: m = 4, 
P = (2,3,1,4) 
D = {2 2 1 0}
    {3 0 6 5}
    {2 5 1 2}
    {5 2 3 0}
